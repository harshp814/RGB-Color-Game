# RGB-Color-Game
A simple RGB Color Game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game gives RGB values and the user have to guess the correct color that Red, Green and Blue when mixed will make from the given options. The game has Easy and Hard mode. In easy mode there are only 3 colored boxes that the user have to guess from while in hard mode there are 6. I made this game when I first learned JavaScript which was a part of Web Developer course that I did on Udemy.
